=head1 NAME

Thread::Cancel - Cancel (i.e., kill) threads

=head1 VERSION

This document describes Thread::Cancel version 1.05

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Thread::Cancel 'SIGUSR1';      # Set the cancellation signal
    use Thread::Cancel;                #  Defaults to 'KILL'

    $thr->cancel();                    # Cancel a thread
    threads->cancel();                 # Cancel all non-detached threads
    threads->cancel($thr, $tid, ...);  # Cancel multiple threads using
                                        #   objects or TIDs

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module adds cancellation capabilities for threads.  Cancelled threads are
terminated using C<threads-E<gt>exit()>.  The thread is then detached, and
hence automatically cleaned up.

Threads that are suspended using L<Thread::Suspend> do not need to be
I<resumed> in order to be cancelled.

It is possible for a thread to cancel itself.

=head2 Declaration

This module must be imported prior to any threads being created.

Cancellation is accomplished via a signal handler which is used by all threads
on which cancel operations are performed.  The signal for this operation can
be specified when this module is declared, and defaults to C<SIGKILL>.
Consequently, the application and its threads must not specify some other
handler for use with the cancel signal.

=over

=item use Thread::Cancel;

Declares this module, and defaults to using C<SIGKILL> for cancel operations.

=item use Thread::Cancel 'SIGUSR1';

=item use Thread::Cancel 'Signal' => 11;

Declares this module, and uses the specified signal for cancel operations.
Signals may be specified by the same names or (positive) numbers as supported
by L<kill()|perlfunc/"kill SIGNAL, LIST">.

=back

=head2 Methods

=over

=item $thr->cancel()

Cancels the threads.

=item threads->cancel()

Cancels all non-detached threads.  This offers a clean way to exit a threaded
application:

    # Terminate all threads and exit
    threads->cancel();
    exit(0);

=item threads->cancel($thr, $tid, ...)

Cancels the threads specified by their objects or TIDs (for non-detached
threads).

=back

=head1 CAVEATS

Subject to the limitations of L<threads/"THREAD SIGNALLING">.

Cancelled threads are automatically detached, so do not try to C<-E<gt>join()>
or C<-E<gt>detach()> a cancelled thread.

Detached threads can only be cancelled using their I<threads> object:

    $thr->detach();
    $thr->cancel();
    # or
    threads->cancel($thr);

Threads that have finished execution are, for the most part, ignored by this
module.

=head1 REQUIREMENTS

Perl 5.8.0 or later

L<threads> 1.34 or later

L<Test::More> 0.50 or later (for installation)
